  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional, increasing the likely hood that someone will want to use their app over similar apps without a README.

  I built a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. The project will help a user to generate a "Readme-File" without having any issues, applying proper mark down syntax.


  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  I used for installation - npm install.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node inex.js’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file under the ‘dist’ folder called ‘generatedREADME’. It’s generated in mark down syntax so you can copy and paste that code into your project!

  ## [Tests](#table-of-contents)

  To test this app, open up the file in VS Code. Open the terminal, change directory into the root folder ‘Readme-Generator-node.js’, and run ‘node index.js’. Answer the prompts and view the preview of the ‘generated-README.md’ file in the ‘dist’ folder.
